# 🛰️ AelafSat1 Orbital Visualization with CesiumJS

This project visualizes the 3D orbit of a simulated satellite — **AelafSat1** — using data generated by NASA's **GMAT (General Mission Analysis Tool)** and rendered interactively with **CesiumJS**. The satellite's real-time trajectory is animated over a realistic 3D globe, complete with orbital path tracing and a 3D satellite model.

## 🔧 Built With
- **NASA GMAT** — to simulate and export orbital position data (EarthMJ2000Eq coordinates).
- **CesiumJS** — to render the Earth and animate the satellite trajectory in real time.
- **JavaScript & WebGL** — for handling data and rendering logic.
- **glTF Model Integration** — a 3D model of the satellite is added for realism.

## 🌍 Features
- Smoothly animated satellite motion based on real orbital mechanics.
- Full trajectory path shown using Cesium’s glowing polyline material.
- Interactive camera and time controls with Cesium's viewer.
- BaseLayerPicker enabled — with **ArcGIS World Imagery** set as default.
- Easily extendable with additional GMAT outputs or models.

## 📁 Files Included
- `index.html`: Main HTML page that loads the CesiumJS viewer.
- `main.js`: Loads satellite position data and animates the orbit.
- `gmat_satellite_trajectory_full.json`: Position data generated from GMAT.
- `model.glb` (optional): External 3D model of the satellite (loaded via URI).

## 🚀 Project Context
This project is part of a broader interest in simulating and visualizing spacecraft orbits using open-source tools. By combining **NASA GMAT** for precision simulation with **CesiumJS** for stunning web-based 3D visualization, this work serves as a prototype for future aerospace data visualizations and educational tools.

## 🧭 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Place your 3D model file (`model.glb`) in the root directory (optional).
3. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser with internet access.
